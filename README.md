Project Name:
Stock Management System - Backend

Description:
This project is the backend implementation for a Stock Management System that provides RESTful APIs to manage stock data. It is built using Spring Boot and communicates with a SQL Server database. The backend is designed to handle CRUD operations for stocks, enabling functionality such as adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting stock information.

Setup and Installation:
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/NMDharan28/backend-stock-management.git
cd backend-stock-management

Configure the Database:

Ensure SQL Server is installed and running.
Create a database named stock_management.
Update the database credentials in application.properties:
properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=stock_management
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

Build the Project:
./mvnw clean install

Run the Application:
./mvnw spring-boot:run

Test the APIs:
Use Postman or any API testing tool to verify the endpoints.

Folder Structure:

├── controller/      # Contains REST controllers for API endpoints.
├── model/           # Contains the Stock entity.
├── repository/      # Interfaces for database interaction.
└── service/         # Business logic and service layer.

Potential Future Enhancements:
Add user authentication and role-based access control (e.g., admin, user).
Implement detailed stock analytics with graphs and reports.
Integrate email notifications for low-stock alerts.
Enable API versioning for better maintainability.
Add unit and integration testing for robust development.
